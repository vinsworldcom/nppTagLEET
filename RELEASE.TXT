-----
Add recognition for TAG(NUMBER) for FILE tags.


Version 1.1.0 - 13/6/2014
-------------------------
Select tag text after lookup.

Automatically adjust column width based on the text.

Allow 'sort' of tags using column headers.

Add icon for FILE tag.

Automatically lookup for files even if extension is not in selection.

If tag is of type FILE and is followed with :NUMBER  automatically go to this
line number.

Search for the tag in the Scintilla document rather than the source file on disk
so correct line will be found in modified files.

Adjust windows size to screen resolution.

Better handling for multi monitor setup.

Go to exact position for 'Back' and 'Forward' rather then start of line.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
Allow absolute path search for /cygwin/ paths.
